Final Test
I couldn’t get my initial bootstrap 4 to link perfectly with my index! 
Took me like 40 mins before I just gave up on it and tried my best to get as close as possible. 
Now for some reason as I upload this to Netlify it doesn’t work! None of my css and js is 
running properly and I can’t figure out where I went wrong. When I open my index file from my computer, 
the website runs find and does exactly what I want, so everything works right but something is missing. 
I just needed more time with my code to figure it out that's why I don't have a step 3 committed to GitHub.
